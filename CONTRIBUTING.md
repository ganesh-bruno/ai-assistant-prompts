### 2. Create Prompt Files
Follow the pattern of existing assistants:
- Include Bruno-specific context
- Provide .bru file format examples
- Explain key concepts (variables, authentication, testing)
- Include best practices

### 3. Create Documentation
Create `docs/your-ai-assistant.md` with:
- Setup instructions
- Configuration details
- Usage examples
- Troubleshooting tips

### 4. Update Main README
Add your AI assistant to the supported list in `README.md`.
